# Basic-Number-Comparison

This program acts as a "bot"-orented game that enables the user to compete with the RNG. Points are awarded when corrct numbers are supplied to the interpeter. The program will automatically terminate when one or none of the participants either wins or loses. There are plans to take the guessing mechanics to another level and combine a multitude of other minigames--such as mia.
